To visualize this properties, let plot a map using the latitud and longitud, and other important properties such as the price property and room price.\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done?

For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\nIt was necessary to reorder the columns to have a better understanding of the raw data, and check what plot \nwould be interesting to show.\n\n## Time Dependent Visualization\nLet’s draw a part-whole relationship by showing different neighbourhood_groups within the sum of bookings of a specific type of room\n\n## Visualizing Part-Whole Relationships\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Bivariate Visualization(s)\nggplot(ab_subset, aes(x=room_type, fill=neighbourhood_group)) +  # setting x-axis as the room_type variable; #filling each room type by a second variable, the neighbourdhood group the property locates in\n \n  geom_bar( ) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Type of Rooms\",\n    y = \"Amount of Bookings\",\n    colour = \"Neighborhood Group\",\n    title = \"Bivariate Visualization: room_type + neighbourhood_group\",\n    subtitle = \"the airbnb dataset (AB_NYC_2019.csv)\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KevinMartell_challenge6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
