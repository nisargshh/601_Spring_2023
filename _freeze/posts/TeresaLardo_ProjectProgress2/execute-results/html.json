The geocoded and weather-enhanced data set I'm using comes courtesy of [Tim Renner](https://data.world/timothyrenner).\n\n## Visualizations\n\n### Create Tree Map for the Regions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Package\nlibrary(treemapify)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n# Plot\nggplot(bfro %>%\n           count(region),\n            aes(fill = region,\n                area = n,\n                label = n)) +\n  geom_treemap() + \n  geom_treemap_text(colour = \"black\",\n                    place = \"centre\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bigfoot Reports by Region in the Continental US\",\n       subtitle = \"Pacific Region leads in Bigfoot Reports\", \n       fill = \"Region\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"left\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TeresaLardo_ProjectProgress2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe treemap shows that the top 3 regions for Bigfoot sightings are the Pacific (California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska), East North Central (Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana), and the South Atlantic (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware). That's still quite a lot of states. I'd like to zoom in on these 3 regions and see which individual states lead in the number of Bigfoot reports in our dataset.\n\n### Bigfoot Reports per State in the Top 3 Regions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bfro %>%\n         filter(region==\"Pacific\" | region==\"East North Central\" | region==\"South Atlantic\") %>%\n           count(state), aes(x = state, y = n)) + \n         geom_bar(stat='identity', color=\"black\", fill=\"forestgreen\") + \n  labs(x = \"State\", y = \"Bigfoot Reports\", title = \"Bigfoot Reports by State\", subtitle = \"Washington and California take lead in number of Bigfoot reports\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") + \n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TeresaLardo_ProjectProgress2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe bar chart above shows that Washington has a dramatic lead over the rest of the states in the top 3 regions, and California comes in second. These are both states within the **Pacific** region.\n\n### Create a Time-Sensitive Dataset\n\nIn order to create any visualizations related to weather conditions, we need to work with reports that have specific dates. Since I intend to create multiple visualizations that depend on that data, I'll create a version of the dataset that contains no NA values for 'date.'\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbfro_timed <- bfro %>%\n  drop_na(date)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Moon Phase Correspondence\n\nThe Moon Phase variable extends from 0 to 1, describing the point in the moon's cycle from new moon to new moon. So a value of 0 denotes a new moon, a value of 0.25 denotes a waxing half moon, 0.5 denotes a full moon, 0.75 denotes a waning half moon, and values closely approaching 1 denote a balsamic moon, leading into the next new moon.\n\nTo explore the question of moon phase correspondence, I can create a basic histogram. I want to see if reports that feature vocalizations are any different in this regard compared to reports without vocalizations, so we'll distinguish the two types of reports by color.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bfro_timed, aes(x=moon_phase, fill=vocalizations)) +\n  geom_histogram(color='black', alpha=0.6, position = 'identity') +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"orange\", \"darkviolet\")) + \n  labs(fill=\"Vocalizations\", y = \"Bigfoot Reports\", x = \"Moon Phase between New Moons\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Bigfoot Reports over the Moon Cycle\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TeresaLardo_ProjectProgress2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe histogram does not indicate any particularly dramatic *increase* in Bigfoot reports over the course of the moon cycle. The periods just before and just after a new moon seem to be popular times for Bigfoot sightings, whereas the times when the moon is actually dark have a dramatic drop in sightings.\n\nThe vocalization reports seem to hold fairly stable during the waning phase of the moon and show more fluctuation during the waxing phase.\n\n### Visibility for Class A & B Reports\n\nThe dataset includes a *classification* variable describing each report as Class A, B, or C. These Class ratings correspond to the potential for misinterpretation of what has been observed. Class A denotes a very low potential for misinterpretation, and Class B denotes a greater potential for misinterpretation (such as sounds heard but no clear view of a creature). Class C has the highest potential for inaccuracy and is the default classification for second-hand reports, so I'm going to eliminate those reports.\n\nI want to see if the visibility on the day of the sighting has a notable correlation with the classification of the report. I would assume a report is more likely to be Class B on days with lower visibility. Let's pair the visibility with the midpoint temperature to see if there's any relationship with temperature as well.\n\n> On the visibility scale, **1** denotes dense fog, **5** denotes thin fog, **8** denotes clear, and **10** denotes exceptionally clear.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bfro_timed %>%\n         filter(classification == \"Class A\" | classification == \"Class B\"), aes(x=temperature_mid, y=visibility, color=classification)) +\n  geom_point(size=3) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"orange\", \"darkviolet\")) + \n  labs(fill=\"Classification\", y = \"Visibility\", x = \"Temperature (Mid)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Classification of Bigfoot Reports & Visibility\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TeresaLardo_ProjectProgress2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis scatterplot shows us that an overwhelming amount of both Class A and Class B reports described sightings that occurred during days with high visibility.\n\nConsidering the points that fall under Visibility 5, the Class B reports do seem to dominate slightly over the Class A reports.\n\n### Temperature\n\nI'd like to make a histogram to see where reports tend to fall in terms of daily temperature. The dataset includes high and low temperatures, but also a midpoint temperature. I am opting to use the *temperature_mid* variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bfro_timed, aes(x=temperature_mid)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5, color=\"black\", fill=\"darkorange\", alpha=0.75, position='identity') + \n  labs(title = \"Temperature During Bigfoot Sightings\", x = \"Daily Temperature (Mid) in Fahrenheit\", y = \"Bigfoot Reports\", subtitle = \"Bin size = 5\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TeresaLardo_ProjectProgress2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe histogram shows that our Bigfoot reports spike when the temperature is in the low-to-mid 60s. The temperatures associated with the majority of the reports will, of course, also correspond to temperatures that people are more likely to be out and about in nature.\n",
