It accepts and analyzes reports of potential adverse events occurring after vaccination. These reports can be submitted by anyone; doctors, vaccine administering sites, and the general public. \n\nVAERS data is partitioned into three tables specific to the type of information captured: \n1) Demographics & limited comorbidities of person receiving dose; dates of exposure, symptom onset, report; type of adverse event and severity\n2) Details on the vaccine exposure including: name, type, manufacturer, dose, route, and site\n3) MedRa coded symptoms associated with vaccinated events \n\n### Proposal for assignment\n\nRather than utilize this data to evaluate safety signals, I'd like to characterize the population submitting reports to this system over time, specifically in the period prior to and post pandemic. The goal is to compare these results to actual rates of vaccination to identify outliers, or conditions where the rate of reporting does not correlate with the rate of vaccination. \n\nPlan of attack:\n1) Limit population to adults receiving flu vaccine and years 2018 - 2022\n2) Characterize each year of data\n3) Explore trends over this time period\n4) Overlap trends with vaccine coverage estimates for same time period and demographic (sources TBD but I think geography will be most interesting)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\n\n\n# Temp import \nX2017VAERSDATA <- read_csv(\"posts/laurenzichittella_finalprojectdata/2017VAERSDATA.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: 'posts/laurenzichittella_finalprojectdata/2017VAERSDATA.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('C:/Users/laure/Desktop/RProjects/601_Spring_2023/posts').\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nX2017VAERSVAX <- read_csv(\"posts/laurenzichittella_finalprojectdata/2017VAERSVAX.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: 'posts/laurenzichittella_finalprojectdata/2017VAERSVAX.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('C:/Users/laure/Desktop/RProjects/601_Spring_2023/posts').\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in VAERS VAX, filter to retain flu vax only\n# Read in VAERS data, filter to retain adults with flu vax only (join)\n```\n:::\n",
