Each test subject is identified by a unique\n\"Subject ID\" and their age and gender are also recorded. The \"Bedtime\"\nand \"Wake-up time\" features indicate when each subject goes to bed and\nwakes up each day, and the \"Sleep duration\" feature records the total\namount of time each subject slept in hours. The \"Sleep efficiency\"\nfeature is a measure of the proportion of time spent in bed that is\nactually spent asleep. The \"REM sleep percentage\", \"Deep sleep\npercentage\", and \"Light sleep percentage\" features indicate the amount\nof time each subject spent in each stage of sleep. The \"Awakenings\"\nfeature records the number of times each subject wakes up during the\nnight. Additionally, the data set includes information about each\nsubject's caffeine and alcohol consumption in the 24 hours prior to\nbedtime, their smoking status, and their exercise frequency.\n\nThe data set provided was collected as part of a study conducted in the\nUK by a research team from The University of Oxfordshire. The study\naimed to investigate the impact of lifestyle factors such as caffeine,\nalcohol, and exercise on sleep patterns and sleep quality. The research\nteam recruited participants from the local community and collected data\nover a period of several months. The data was collected using a\ncombination of self-reported surveys, actigraphy, and polysomnography\nwhich is a sleep monitoring technique. The data was then analyzed to\nunderstand the relationship between lifestyle factors and sleep patterns\nand to identify any potential areas for intervention to improve sleep.\n\nI am interested in finding sleep inhibitors for young adults, so I'll\nfilter to ages from 21-35. I would like to look at under 35 more generally, but due to the alcohol and smoking variables, the filter must designate 21 as the minimum age.\n\n## Description {#describe-the-data-sets-1}\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"C:/Github Projects/601_Spring_2023/posts\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetwd(\"C:/Github Projects/601_Spring_2023/posts/ConnorLandreth_FinalProjectData\")\nsleep <- read.csv(\"Sleep_Efficiency.csv\")\n#View(sleep)\n#head(sleep)\ndim(sleep)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 452  15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDimensions on the raw sleep data include 452 observations over 15\nvariables\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(unique(sleep$ID))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 452\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(unique(sleep$Age))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 61\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(unique(sleep$Gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(sleep)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       ID             Age           Gender            Bedtime         \n Min.   :  1.0   Min.   : 9.00   Length:452         Length:452        \n 1st Qu.:113.8   1st Qu.:29.00   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :226.5   Median :40.00   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :226.5   Mean   :40.29                                        \n 3rd Qu.:339.2   3rd Qu.:52.00                                        \n Max.   :452.0   Max.   :69.00                                        \n                                                                      \n Wakeup.time        Sleep.duration   Sleep.efficiency REM.sleep.percentage\n Length:452         Min.   : 5.000   Min.   :0.5000   Min.   :15.00       \n Class :character   1st Qu.: 7.000   1st Qu.:0.6975   1st Qu.:20.00       \n Mode  :character   Median : 7.500   Median :0.8200   Median :22.00       \n                    Mean   : 7.466   Mean   :0.7889   Mean   :22.62       \n                    3rd Qu.: 8.000   3rd Qu.:0.9000   3rd Qu.:25.00       \n                    Max.   :10.000   Max.   :0.9900   Max.   :30.00       \n                                                                          \n Deep.sleep.percentage Light.sleep.percentage   Awakenings   \n Min.   :18.00         Min.   : 7.00          Min.   :0.000  \n 1st Qu.:48.25         1st Qu.:15.00          1st Qu.:1.000  \n Median :58.00         Median :18.00          Median :1.000  \n Mean   :52.82         Mean   :24.56          Mean   :1.641  \n 3rd Qu.:63.00         3rd Qu.:32.50          3rd Qu.:3.000  \n Max.   :75.00         Max.   :63.00          Max.   :4.000  \n                                              NA's   :20     \n Caffeine.consumption Alcohol.consumption Smoking.status     Exercise.frequency\n Min.   :  0.00       Min.   :0.000       Length:452         Min.   :0.000     \n 1st Qu.:  0.00       1st Qu.:0.000       Class :character   1st Qu.:0.000     \n Median : 25.00       Median :0.000       Mode  :character   Median :2.000     \n Mean   : 23.65       Mean   :1.174                          Mean   :1.791     \n 3rd Qu.: 50.00       3rd Qu.:2.000                          3rd Qu.:3.000     \n Max.   :200.00       Max.   :5.000                          Max.   :5.000     \n NA's   :25           NA's   :14                             NA's   :6         \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are 452 unique IDs, so each row is an individual.

As someone who has\nslept poorly essentially forever, I am very interested to see what\ntrends emerge.\n\nI want to see what individual effects all of those things have on sleep.\nI'm also interested to see if alcohol actually plays a role in advanced sleep for heavy drinkers or if caffeine doesn't play a role in poor sleep for heavy users because they've developed an immunity to it.

Males do show a resurgence in sleep efficiency from 2 to 3\ndrinks, but it starts to diminish again after 3/4. The way I interpret this is that women in the sample all experience reduced sleep efficiency the more they drink, but for men, two drinks actually sees the nadir of sleep efficiency.\n\nPerhaps because the mind often becomes more active off of 1-2 drinks, men are experiencing increased mental stimulus and activity, making it harder to sleep. Then as they get up to 3-4 drinks (likely a bit drunk and relaxed), efficiency goes back up, but still not as high as it would be with no drinks.\nNext, I'll look at the same thing for caffeine.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_sleep %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Caffeine.consumption,Sleep.efficiency, color=Gender))+\n  geom_point(size=2, alpha = 0.5)+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  labs(x='Caffeine Consumption', y='Sleep Efficiency') +\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  labs(title=\"Caffeine Consumption & Sleep Efficiency by Gender\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](final_project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese are interesting results.

I would be inclined to surmise that\ncaffeine effects them little, or they drink it only in the early\nmorning.\n\nFor men, most consume none, but oddly, as consumption increases, so too\ndoes sleep efficiency. Again though, much likely has to do with time of\nday caffeine is consumed, so I am inclined to once again believe these\nindividuals aren't effected much by caffeine, so are able to consume\nmore. Overall though, all of these high-efficiency-sleepers consume a\nreasonable amount, and sleep very well. Thirdly, we'll look at exercise.\nHow often are these efficient sleepers exercising?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_sleep %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Exercise.frequency,Sleep.efficiency, color=Gender))+\n  geom_point(size=2, alpha = 0.5)+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  labs(x='Exercise Frequency', y='Sleep Efficiency') +\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  labs(title=\"Exercise Frequency & Sleep Efficiency by Gender\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](final_project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf this subset of efficient sleepers, the least efficient are those who\ndo no excessive at all. For women, the most efficient sleepers appear to\nexercise between 3-4 times per week. For men, The maximum amount of days\nthese efficient sleepers exercised was 4 days. 4 days also led to\nmaximum sleep efficiency at over 0.9. So, it appears for both men an women, although they follow different paths to get there, four days of exercise yields maximum sleep efficiency.\n\nLastly, I will take a look at awaken category and smoking category.\nFirst, I will use n_sleep data set to look at all awakenings, then\nfilter for smoking and see if the trends change. I would imagine those\nwho smoke wake up more often because their body is craving nicotine/.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nn_sleep %>% \n  drop_na(Awakenings) %>% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=Awakenings))+\n  labs( title = \"Awakenings for 21-35\")+\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"maroon\", alpha = 0.85,\n                 bins = 12.5) +\n  theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](final_project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor the whole sample, we see a bit of a spread, but people mainly in\nbetween 0-1 awakening. There are about 75 individuals who wake up more\nthan once.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_sleep <- n_sleep %>%\n      mutate(Smoking.status = ifelse(Smoking.status == \"No\",0,1))\nn_sleep %>% \n  filter(Smoking.status == \"1\") %>% \n  drop_na(Awakenings) %>% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=Awakenings))+\n  labs( title = \"Awakenings for All 21-35 Smokers\")+\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"maroon\", alpha = 0.85,\n                 bins = 12.5) +\n  theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](final_project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInterestingly, smoking seems to not have the effect I had anticipated it\nmight, with the majority (\\~30) waking between 0-1 times, and \\~20\nwaking up between 2-5 times. This implies a moderately similar graph in\nthe non-smokers as well, as there was limited change in trend from the\nentire sample to this smoker-subset.\n\n## Conculsion\n\nIn general, young adults (aged 21-35) saw enhanced sleep\nefficiency (proportion of time spent in bed actually spent asleep) when\nthey had higher exercise rates and lower alcohol consumption (with the male 2-3 drink caveat). The fact 2-3 drinks promotes slightly better sleep in men is not a promotion or sign to go drink alcohol every night. The evidence against caffeine and smoking was inconclusive, but many high efficiency sleepers did in fact smoke and have limited awakenings. Also, many caffeine consumers were high-efficiency sleepers. One question regarding alcohol and caffeine I would need to form a greater argument for correlation would be time of day the caffeine or alcohol was\nconsumed.\n",
