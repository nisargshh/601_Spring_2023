presumably this is data from a booking service that has multiple hotel customers\n\n* Arrival date, which is broken into several columns including year, month, day, week, etc.\n* Occupants of each stay (adults, children, babies)\n\n* Market segments and distribution channels\n\n* Average daily rate (ADR) - from some research this seems to be the average rate across all rooms for a given date\n\n* Lead time - or the time from booking to arrival\n\n## Tidy-ing and mutating data\n\nOne of the main problems with the data set for analysis purposes is that the arrival date is broken into various character columns. To fix this, I mutated the the arrival month names into numeric values, and then used lubridate to create a new single column for arrival date in the proper format.\n\nSome of the variables (such as whether the stay was canceled, or whether it was a repeat guest) were in binary (0,1) format. I converted these into logical TRUE/FALSE variables.\n\nI also created a new column for total nights stayed, which combined week and weekend nights stayed.\n\nAfter completing these steps I would expect to see:\n33(original) - 4 (individual arrival date columns) + 1 (new arrival date) + 1 (custom arrival date with month only for further anlysis) = 31 columns\nWhich is confirmed by my sanity check below.\n\nYou can also see that the new \"arrival_date\" column is in date format.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#converting months to numerics to use in make date\nhoteldatatidy <- hoteldata %>%\n  mutate(monthnumeric = case_when(\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"January\" ~ 1,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"February\" ~ 2,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"March\" ~ 3,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"April\" ~ 4,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"May\" ~ 5,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"June\" ~ 6,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"July\" ~ 7,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"August\" ~ 8,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"September\" ~ 9,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"October\" ~ 10,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"November\" ~ 11,\n    `arrival_date_month` == \"December\" ~ 12)) %>%\n  \n  #turning separate arrival date columns into a single arrival date\n  mutate(arrival_date = make_date(year = arrival_date_year, month = monthnumeric, day = arrival_date_day_of_month)) %>%\n  \n  #making custom month-only column\n  mutate(arrival_month = make_date(year = arrival_date_year, month = monthnumeric)) %>%\n  \n  #mutating binary 0/1 columns to be TRUE/FALSE\n  mutate(is_canceled = case_when(\n    `is_canceled` == 0 ~ FALSE,\n    `is_canceled` == 1 ~ TRUE,)) %>%\n  mutate(is_repeated_guest = case_when(\n    `is_repeated_guest` == 0 ~ FALSE,\n    `is_repeated_guest` == 1 ~ TRUE,)) %>%\n  \n  #combining week and weekend nights stayed for a total column\n  mutate(total_nights_stayed = stays_in_weekend_nights + stays_in_week_nights) %>%\n  \n  #deselecting unused columns\n  select(-c(`monthnumeric`, `arrival_date_day_of_month`, `arrival_date_week_number`, `arrival_date_month`, `arrival_date_year`))\n\n#doing some sanity checks\nhead(hoteldatatidy$arrival_date)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"2015-07-01\" \"2015-07-01\" \"2015-07-01\" \"2015-07-01\" \"2015-07-01\"\n[6] \"2015-07-01\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(hoteldatatidy)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 119390     31\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##Preparing data for visualization\nBefore creating a time series visualization, I wanted to create a summary table, showing the means of key values like Lead Time, ADR and Total Nights Stayed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmonthlymeans <- hoteldatatidy %>%\n  group_by(arrival_month) %>%\n  summarize(mean_lead_time = mean(lead_time),\n            mean_adr = mean(adr),\n            mean_stay = mean(total_nights_stayed))\nhead(monthlymeans)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  arrival_month mean_lead_time mean_adr mean_stay\n  <date>                 <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 2015-07-01             126.      97.8      3.87\n2 2015-08-01              99.4    106.       3.70\n3 2015-09-01             123.      94.8      3.47\n4 2015-10-01             102.      78.9      3.06\n5 2015-11-01              48.1     60.6      3.27\n6 2015-12-01              52.4     74.1      3.04\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Time Dependent Visualization - ADR and Lead Time by Month\nIt would be interesting to see how lead time and ADR vary by month, so that the hotel knows what the most important months are for their business, both in terms of lots people booking in advance and average revenue.\n\nUsing our means table, below I have plotted a time-series chart of mean ADR and Lead Time by month from 2015-2017.\n\nAs you can see, they track each other quite closely, tending to rise in the summer months and decrease in the winter months.\nThis is expected to me, as the busy summer holiday season would be both more expensive, and need to be booked further in advance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#creating a ggplot using monthlymeans table\n#setting the x axis as arrival date\nleadtimeandadr <- ggplot(monthlymeans, aes(x = arrival_month)) + \n  \n  #creating line and point plots for mean lead time\n  geom_line(aes(y = mean_lead_time, color = \"#b3697a\")) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = mean_lead_time, color = \"#b3697a\")) +\n  \n  #creating line and point plots for mean ADR\n  geom_line(aes(y = mean_adr, color = \"#69b3a2\")) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = mean_adr, color = \"#69b3a2\")) +\n  \n  #setting y scale and creating an additional y axis on the right side\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Mean Lead Time (Days)\",\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(~., name=\"Mean ADR ($)\")) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b %y\", date_breaks = \"2 months\", name = \"Month\") +\n  \n  #setting theme options\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1),\n        axis.title.y.left = element_text(color = \"#b3697a\"),\n        axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = \"#69b3a2\"),\n        legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Mean Lead Time and Mean ADR by Month\")\n\n#plotting\nleadtimeandadr\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](JosephVincent_challenge6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Visualizing Part-Whole Relationships\nNext, It would be interesting to see if this trend of busy summers, less busy winters, exists for both types of hotels (resort and city) or if its being skewed by the resort hotels.\n\nI'll create a plot that shows the number of hotel stays by month, broken down by type of hotel (city or resort).\n\nAs we can see, the number of city hotel bookings outweighs the resort bookings by quite a lot.
