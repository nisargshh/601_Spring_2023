(The state and county columns are both essential for defining a case, since some county names occur in more than one state, and the state column is necessary for disambiguation.) The total_employees column indicates the number of railroad employees in the relevant county.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmedian(railroad_data$total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 21\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(railroad_data$total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 87.17816\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf US counties with at least one railroad employee, the median county had 21 railroad employees, while the mean county had slightly more than 87. This suggests that a handful of counties with very large numbers of railroad employees are dragging the mean upwards relative to more typical counties.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstates <- select(railroad_data, state)\ntable(states)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nstates\n AE  AK  AL  AP  AR  AZ  CA  CO  CT  DC  DE  FL  GA  HI  IA  ID  IL  IN  KS  KY \n  1   6  67   1  72  15  55  57   8   1   3  67 152   3  99  36 103  92  95 119 \n LA  MA  MD  ME  MI  MN  MO  MS  MT  NC  ND  NE  NH  NJ  NM  NV  NY  OH  OK  OR \n 63  12  24  16  78  86 115  78  53  94  49  89  10  21  29  12  61  88  73  33 \n PA  RI  SC  SD  TN  TX  UT  VA  VT  WA  WI  WV  WY \n 65   5  46  52  91 221  25  92  14  39  69  53  22 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprop.table(table(states))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nstates\n          AE           AK           AL           AP           AR           AZ \n0.0003412969 0.0020477816 0.0228668942 0.0003412969 0.0245733788 0.0051194539 \n          CA           CO           CT           DC           DE           FL \n0.0187713311 0.0194539249 0.0027303754 0.0003412969 0.0010238908 0.0228668942 \n          GA           HI           IA           ID           IL           IN \n0.0518771331 0.0010238908 0.0337883959 0.0122866894 0.0351535836 0.0313993174 \n          KS           KY           LA           MA           MD           ME \n0.0324232082 0.0406143345 0.0215017065 0.0040955631 0.0081911263 0.0054607509 \n          MI           MN           MO           MS           MT           NC \n0.0266211604 0.0293515358 0.0392491468 0.0266211604 0.0180887372 0.0320819113 \n          ND           NE           NH           NJ           NM           NV \n0.0167235495 0.0303754266 0.0034129693 0.0071672355 0.0098976109 0.0040955631 \n          NY           OH           OK           OR           PA           RI \n0.0208191126 0.0300341297 0.0249146758 0.0112627986 0.0221843003 0.0017064846 \n          SC           SD           TN           TX           UT           VA \n0.0156996587 0.0177474403 0.0310580205 0.0754266212 0.0085324232 0.0313993174 \n          VT           WA           WI           WV           WY \n0.0047781570 0.0133105802 0.0235494881 0.0180887372 0.0075085324 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nAmong all states and state-equivalents, the number of counties and county-equivalents that have at least one railroad worker ranges from one (in Washington, DC and each of the two military entities) to 221 (in Texas). This is roughly commensurate with what one would expect, given the overall number of counties in each state. About 7.5% of all counties and county-equivalents that have at least one railroad worker are in Texas. (Although the overall impact is small, note that the data in the proportional table is slightly distorted by the fact that it aggregates railroad worker data for all of Virginia's independent cities as one entry rather than breaking them out as separate county-equivalents.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroad_data%>%\n  select(state, county)%>%\n  n_distinct()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2930\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThis shows that there are 2390 cases (consisting of state-county combinations) in the data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Rendering your post\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. \n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nBe sure that you have moved your `*.qmd` file into the `posts` folder **BEFORE** you render it, so that all files are stored in the correct location.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nOnly render a single file - don't try to render the whole website!\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Pilot Student Blogs\n\nWe are piloting a workflow including individual student websites with direted and limited pull requests back to course blogs.
