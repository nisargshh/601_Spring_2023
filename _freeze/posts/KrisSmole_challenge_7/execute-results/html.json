Responses from survey participants are in binary form of yes/no, and for each response type,a percentage of the yes/no responses of each territory is also included in the data frame.  \n\nWe'll look at a very simple bar chart to quickly visualize the outcome of the vote. We've updated this bar graph from Challenge 5 to include colors, x-axis and y-axis labeling features, and a Title for the graph, left out in the first presentation of this bar graph in Challenge 5.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nam<-read.csv(\"_data/australian_marriage_tidy.csv\")\n\n  ggplot(am, aes(x=resp, y=`count`, fill=resp)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")+\n  labs(title = \"Australian Marriage Law Votes, 2017\", y = \"Count of Votes\", x = \"Vote of No or Yes by Australian Voters\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KrisSmole_challenge_7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach bar in the graph is a representation of the percent of that particular vote. The bar for Yes votes is taller than the bar for No votes, representing a greater count of yes votes than no votes. We can see the majority of Australians voted to allow same-sex coupled to marry, demonstrated in the taller bar for yes votes, again, indicating more yes votes than no votes.\n\n## Basic Violin Plot of Australian Marriage Law Vote\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nam<-read.csv(\"_data/australian_marriage_tidy.csv\")\n\nggplot(am, aes(x=resp, y=count, fill=resp)) + \n  geom_violin()+\n  labs(title = \"Australian Marriage Law Votes, 2017\", y = \"Count of Votes\", x = \"Vote of No or Yes by Australian Voters\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KrisSmole_challenge_7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nam\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                         territory resp   count percent\n1                  New South Wales  yes 2374362    57.8\n2                  New South Wales   no 1736838    42.2\n3                         Victoria  yes 2145629    64.9\n4                         Victoria   no 1161098    35.1\n5                       Queensland  yes 1487060    60.7\n6                       Queensland   no  961015    39.3\n7                  South Australia  yes  592528    62.5\n8                  South Australia   no  356247    37.5\n9                Western Australia  yes  801575    63.7\n10               Western Australia   no  455924    36.3\n11                        Tasmania  yes  191948    63.6\n12                        Tasmania   no  109655    36.4\n13           Northern Territory(b)  yes   48686    60.6\n14           Northern Territory(b)   no   31690    39.4\n15 Australian Capital Territory(c)  yes  175459    74.0\n16 Australian Capital Territory(c)   no   61520    26.0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can see the basic violin plot doesn't give us much more value than the bar plot done above. This is what Tufte might call unneeded chart ink, although if the basic violin plot was presented without the bar plot, it would suffice to provide a visualization, although no more valuable than the bar plot.\n\n## Bar Plot - Publication Ready...almost...\n\nLet's try another attempt the bar plot to find more meaning to the visualization of the data frame.\n \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(am, aes(x=territory,y=`count`, fill=`count`)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")+\n   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(suffix = \" Million\"))+\n  labs(title = \"Australian Marriage Law Votes, 2017\", y = \"Count of Votes\", x = \"Vote of No or Yes by Australian Voters\",subtitle = \"Data set(australian_marriage_tidy.csv)\")+\n theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KrisSmole_challenge_7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nAlright!  This is giving some visual meaning to the data!\n\nNow we can see some perspective to the vote counts by territory. We see the variation of voter populations among the territories: Australian Capital Territory has total votes of less than a half of a million votes, while New South Wales Territory has total votes of just over 4 million votes. We can see the relative impact of each territory's votes on the overall Australian vote by looking at each territory's total votes count. We can also see, signified by the different shades within each territory's bar, the proportion of yes and no votes of each territory. \n\nThe yes and no votes of each territory would be a more meaningful visual with one color for yes, and another color for no. Increasing the size of the Y axis, but still using the vote counts would also provide better opportunity to see the yes and not votes of the smaller territories.  In the current plot, the smaller territories seem to have one color in the bar, which is due to the scale of the Y axis, because each territory does, indeed, have both yes and not votes, as we have seen previously in the last challenge 5 plot. The key to the graph can also be improved through the addition of two colors in the bars. This opportunity to increase the Y axis scale and use two colors for the different type of vote will be utilized in future plots of similar data.\n\n",
