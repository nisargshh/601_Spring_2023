Introduction \n\n### Dataset\n\nFor my final project, I want to work with a data set on Bigfoot reports (\"reports\" includes direct sightings of or encounters with a creature purported to be Bigfoot, vocalizations thought to be those of a Sasquatch, and discoveries of a Bigfoot-like footprint). This data set describes just over 5000 Bigfoot reports within the continental United States dated from November 1869 to November 2021. The data on Bigfoot sightings is largely self-reported, though some of the earlier reports are taken from newspaper reports. \n\nThe report data comes from The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, or [BFRO](https://www.bfro.net/), and supplemental data on weather and environmental conditions were added from Dark Sky API. The geocoded and weather-enhanced data set I'm using comes courtesy of [Tim Renner](https://data.world/timothyrenner). \n\n### Questions\n\nWith this data set, I want to explore the relationships between types of reports in different locations and environmental conditions over time:\n\n* How have the amount of Bigfoot reports in different states & geographic regions fluctuated over time? (For example, have sightings in New England increased notably since the 1970s? Was there a spike in reports from Texas in the mid-90s?)\n* Do sightings or reports of vocalizations correspond strongly with a specific moon phase? \n* Are Class A reports more likely to correspond with clear weather conditions, and do Class B reports correspond to foggy weather, low visibility? \n\n## Part 2.

It was dusk as I was pulling out of the river and I was trying to hurry to get all my gear in the car before it got dark as it was about a 60 yard walk up this steep hill to where my car was. Just as I was flipping the canoe up to put on my shoulders I heard this very loud \\\"WHOOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP\\\", then a pause then three more whoops. I 've been in the woods enough to know it was not an owl or like any sound I've EVER heard in the woods or on a river. Too loud, too powerful. It felt like it came frome about a quarter to a half mile away. It scared the piss out of me. You've never seen a guy hustle a 75 lbs canoe on their shoulders and practically run up the hill. I didn't even tie it on properly until I got up to the highway. The weird part was I had been watching the Monster Quest series and the month before had come down the same river and thought \\\"This area looks just like that crap they show in the Pacific Northwest where those bogfoots are. Wonder if there were ever any bigfoots in Alabama?\\\" So I did an internet search and it surprised the crap out of me and found a whole freakin website about Alabama Bigfoots. Those sounds I heard sounded just like the whoops you have on this web site. Of course after watching those shows it could have been somebody doing that call blasting thing but I had emailed the Alabama Research people and they said they did not have anyone working that area at that time(AUG 2010). Over the last year I have had a few \\\"unusual\\\" moments in this area. No sightings but well, I'm short on time. The WHOOOPS were the important thing, scared the hell out of me.\",\"8\":\"NA\",\"9\":\"Summer\",\"10\":\"NA\",\"11\":\"NA\",\"12\":\"NA\",\"13\":\"NA\",\"14\":\"NA\",\"15\":\"NA\",\"16\":\"NA\",\"17\":\"NA\",\"18\":\"NA\",\"19\":\"NA\",\"20\":\"NA\",\"21\":\"NA\",\"22\":\"NA\",\"23\":\"NA\",\"24\":\"NA\",\"25\":\"NA\",\"26\":\"NA\",\"27\":\"NA\",\"28\":\"NA\"},{\"1\":\"1\",\"2\":\"<NA>\",\"3\":\"NA\",\"4\":\"Alaska\",\"5\":\"Valdez-Chitina-Whittier County\",\"6\":\"Class A\",\"7\":\"Ed L. was salmon fishing with a companion in Prince William Sound.

It was Sunday evening about 10:00pm when I decided to head back to school on my ten speed bike. Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded, country like setting but yet city. I was going down her street and noticed my front center pull brake needed to be adjusted. I stopped under a street light at the end of her street which is an intersection to adjust the brake. Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me,pitch black background, tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light. Typical New England, Oak, Maple and, Pine trees. As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped, comig from the field on the slope side,more like a crushing thud. I could hear the actual compression being placed, like someone dropping a heavy metal ball/rock on the ground.I looked up to see if I could see anything and just said to myself \\\"its nothing\\\", and went back to fixing my brake. I noticed it was getting closer and felt very apprehensive, the sound was coming in my direction. All of sudden this dog starts barking like crazy, I can hear the chain snap as it either tries to attack or getaway from something. I said to myself \\\"its time to go!\\\", as I started I turned left to head north, into a few pedals. From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla. The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles. Twenty maybe twenty five feet away, directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more. Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles, knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass. The face dark, deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face. The nose and mouth are human like, it's nose is wide, around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me, eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real. Humanlike in appearance, the face is not like a primate but has a distinct animal presence (the eye are close together). I was never so scared in my life and knew had I stayed I don't think I would of survived the attack.The way it was positioned gave it an explosive start as it decides to chase me down the street. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs, then down on its knuckles then back up again. Perhaps for ten yards, I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach,I thank god I was in first gear. A good five second chase and it was all over.It had stopped in the middle of the street just swaying back and forth, turned and just cleared this rock wall all in one motion from a grass sidewalk. At the top of hill I began riding in circles, I didn't know what to do, I could not comprehend the situation I was in. I knew one thing I was not riding back. I cut through her grandmother's yards and made it back to her house. Not trying to look crazy or anything they ask me what's wrong ? I told them what happened and agreed  that it was best to go back in the morning.\",\"8\":\"Great swamp area, Narragansett Indians\",\"9\":\"Fall\",\"10\":\"41.4500\",\"11\":\"-71.5000\",\"12\":\"drm5ucxrc0\",\"13\":\"78.17\",\"14\":\"73.425\",\"15\":\"68.68\",\"16\":\"65.72\",\"17\":\"0.86\",\"18\":\"0.86\",\"19\":\"0.16\",\"20\":\"0\",\"21\":\"0\",\"22\":\"NA\",\"23\":\"1020.61\",\"24\":\"Foggy until afternoon.\",\"25\":\"4\",\"26\":\"2.75\",\"27\":\"198\",\"28\":\"6.92\"},{\"1\":\"3\",\"2\":\"<NA>\",\"3\":\"NA\",\"4\":\"Pennsylvania\",\"5\":\"York County\",\"6\":\"Class B\",\"7\":\"Hello, My name is Doug and though I am very reluctant to post this story; I am going to do so anyways. The area that this happened  could not be a more unlikely area for a bigfoot occurance then or  especially now with all the development of the farmland in the last 25 years which has been extensive and at a phenominal rate. After reading many (if not every last report on this website) and coming across more that a few that have happened in improbable areas (bigfoot running down neighborhood streets and sightings/ vocalizations near condo areas), I decided there just might be some merit in submitting this for review. A skilled researcher might be able to shed some more light maybe. My friends parents owned a small somewhat defunct farm with (I'm guessing maybe 15-20 acres of land -not the best judge on that) They had 3 horses; 2 mares that were allowed out in the field areas; a stabled stallion, and a pony I believe. The barn was in dis-repair and part of the roof had collapsed years earlier. There was a large pond that was almost completely enclosed with an impenatrable thicket of briars ringing almost the whole cirmcuference of the pond, except for a small area that was kept open for access for the horses to water. Much of the property was overgrown with these same briars that tended to make big circular mounds here and there in the field. The house sat close to the road; the barn to the left and further behind. The extreme left side of their property was bordered by a small stream that edged along a small (100 ft x 30 ft) stand of very dense pine trees. These pines (species unknown) tend to have a very dense understory of almost horizontal dead, dry, branches due to years of growth an minimal sunlight. The lower end of this pine grove had a mowed lawn area (next door neighbors property who were also related to my friend family) You had to access the camping area through the neighbors propery as the overgrowth of briars and other weeds, brambles, trees made it impossible to get there directly for the E------- property. The pond in relation to the campsite was to the left if you were looking back up towards the road; with the stream running between. The dense pine grove then lay between you and the road; unless you skirted around it through the neigbors backyard. This is what happened. No sighting but a vocalization. We had gone down to the campsite had built a fire and been down there for about an hour. During this time we all felt uneasy even though we had been there before many times. This is a long time ago but to the best of my memory we had been joking; probably made something to eat over the fire but something felt really wrong this time. \\\"Wrong\\\" is the best word I can use to describe. I remember I felt like I couldn't just sit down by the fire and stay with the conversation though. From back in the pine grove was the occasional, deliberate braking of branches that were just a little too large (to the sophisticated human ear) and just had the sound of being \\\"up off the ground some ways\\\" This would start and stop. We would listen and comment on it. First we thought maybe the mares had gotten back into the woods, unusual but this later was confirmed not to be so because we found out the next day that they were stabled for the night. We then thought it might be some older boys who were trying to scare us into running. It would be quiet for awhile then there would be a sense of movement closer to where we were and then receeding. We shined a flashlight and ventured back alittle ways but saw or smelled nothing. The sounds began again this time definately agitated, insistent with a very permiable feeling. We started to get un-nerved  moved out into the neighbors backyard. The sound grew louder, with traceable movement and then this ear splitting scream cut right out into the night. One loud shriek louder than anything should have to be. It just cut right to the core of your soul. Like so many reports I've read on this website, it's virtually impossible to do it justice with a human description precisly because it sounded so inhuman. We just ran like hell back to the house, left everything behind. No sense of being followed at all. No visual sighting (I almost wish). No bad smells or odors. In terms of other reports this pales, I know. But this is what happened and I never forgot it. We knew what Sasquatch were at the time, but no one ever heard of sightings east of the Mississippi to the best of my memory then. We kind of joked that maybe that's what our unseen friend was. Years later when I read and saw the reports from the southern part of York County (report on file with your website.) did I ever give any serious thought.\",\"8\":\"I would rather not have exact location (listing the nearest road) to repect the privacy of the family that still owns the property. I have long since had a falling out with my friend at the time and don't feel he or they would like being approache about this. I like my own privacy respected; so I must accord others the same. The general area at that time was more open farmland with some large housing developements (in which I lived) within a mile. There were a good deal of homes scattered here and there and others in smaller developments. A very large animal like a Sasquatch could conceivably navigate (migrate) through an area like this at night using farmland as cover; but absolutely not stay very long in an area like that even then without revealing it's presense. I can give you more specific details on topography. Farmland opens up eventually much more to the north with a State Park (Gifford Pinchot) at the north end of the county. Southern end of York county where the  sightings occurred is a more likely area given in terms of what I've read of similar topography of other sighting then. Also much more rural and forested in the early \\\"70's.\",\"9\":\"Summer\",\"10\":\"NA\",\"11\":\"NA\",\"12\":\"NA\",\"13\":\"NA\",\"14\":\"NA\",\"15\":\"NA\",\"16\":\"NA\",\"17\":\"NA\",\"18\":\"NA\",\"19\":\"NA\",\"20\":\"NA\",\"21\":\"NA\",\"22\":\"NA\",\"23\":\"NA\",\"24\":\"NA\",\"25\":\"NA\",\"26\":\"NA\",\"27\":\"NA\",\"28\":\"NA\"},{\"1\":\"4\",\"2\":\"<NA>\",\"3\":\"NA\",\"4\":\"Oregon\",\"5\":\"Yamhill County\",\"6\":\"Class B\",\"7\":\"It was May 1984. Two friends and I were up in the hills nw of Yamhill, OR, late in the evening, around 10:30 pm. We heard the scream, a VERY low, very long howl. Not a coyote, bear or cougar. Have heard all of them before. This was nothing like anything I have ever heard. I still remember thinking to myself \\\"How in the hell can something make such a low howl.\\\" It scared us at first, but is sounded like it was far away, like maybe a mile or so. We were drinking a little beer, so after awhile we relaxed and forgot about it. It must have been about a half hour later when we heard it again. I swear that it had to be within 30 yards of us. Same loud, low howl, but MUCH closer. And it sounded pissed. I could feel the sound vibrations bouncing off the back of my neck. The hair stood up on the back of all of our necks. All of us turned white as hell, and our jaws dropped past our knees. The howl seemed to say \\\"GET OUT!\\\" Which is EXACTLY what we did. I just looked at the two other guys and said \\\"lets get the @#$ outta here \\\". We did not see anything, but felt the presence. I grew up within 10 miles of that spot. I had never heard that sound before, or since, EXCEPT on a television show that had a report of a bigfoot sighting. A guy in Idaho caught one on video (at least it looked like one), but when I saw the video, I heard that scream again. The guy taking the video threw the camera in the ditch, and hid. It was the SAME scream. ONLY other time that I have EVER heard it. It was EXACTLY the same scream. I saw this video on a news show, something like \\\"Real TV\\\" while in Fairfax, VA, in 1992 or 1993. I do not know EXACTLY what it is that we heard, but I know what I think it was. Bigfoot.

I was driving and my son (age 11) was sitting in the front seat beside me and my daughter (age 12) was sitting in the back seat leaning forward between the driver and passenger seat. It was a clear sunny day about 3 PM and there was a lull in the conversation. It was quiet in the car, we did not have the radio on and all three of us were happened to be looking straight ahead. I noticed a movement on the left side of the road and was amazed to see a what I percieved to be a very large black man-like creature rise from a squatting position and run across the two lane highway about 30 yards ahead. It ran across the highway, covering the distance in only three steps, I estimate the creature to have been at least 8 feet tall, it glanced briefly in the direction of the car and I instictively applied the brake so as not to hit it. It ran into the bar ditch on the east side of the road and ducked into some brush and large bushes between the ditch and the barbed wire fence. It had hair that looked rather silky as it ran, I remember seeing the hair move as it ran. The hair did not appear to be stiff like an animals hair but more soft and shiny.

There are over 5,000 cases in this set, and the dataset includes: \n\n* descriptions of the events of the encounter, \n* the date & season of the encounter, \n* the location (including state, county, latitude, longitude, geohash, and details describing the specific location such as \"near the summit of Mt. Mitchell\" or \"north of Highway 285\"), \n* title of the report, \n* classification of the sighting (relating to the circumstantial potential for misinterpretation of the observation). **Class A** denotes to a very low potential for misinterpretation, **Class B** denotes a greater potential for misinterpretation or misidentification such as in the case of sounds heard but no clear view of a creature, and **Class C** denotes a high potential for inaccuracy due to being second-hand reports or having untraceable sources), \n* and environmental conditions for reports with specified dates, including **temperature** (high, low, mid), dew point, humidity, **cloud cover**, **moon phase**, precipitation (type, probability & intensity), atmospheric pressure, UV index, wind bearing & wind speed, **visibility**, and a textual summary of the weather conditions of the day in the report's location. \n\nI plan to focus on the environmental variables of *temperature*, *cloud cover*, *visibility*, and *moon phase*. \n\n\n\n## 3. The Tentative Plan for Visualization \n\n\nIn order to explore the question of changes in amount of reports by state and region over time, I plan to mutate the data to create a \"**Region**\" variable to better chunk together the geographic data, and then create a time series visualization for the different regions. From there, I can hone in on any regional spikes in activity and investigate the activity at the state level (for states in that region). I want to also look into the details on creating a choropleth map and see if I can integrate an animated time series element into that. I have created some maps on ArcGIS with this data set before, and I think a choropleth map would be a great way to show which areas \"light up\" with activity within a given timespan. \n\nTo explore the question of moon phase correspondence, I can start with a basic scatterplot. I would like to use string searching to detect which reports are visual vs. auditory and categorize the reports of vocalizations separately from the visual sightings, and use color to distinguish these two categories on the moon phase scatterplot. \n\nTo explore the question of Class A & B reports and relative visibility, I can again start with a basic scatterplot where Class A & B reports are distinguished by color. This should give a quick sense of any trends by level of visibility for both classifications. I would also like to dig into the weather details in the \"Summary\" variable, such as searching for words like \"fog\" and \"foggy\" versus \"clear,\" and see which classes of reports show up most for reports with these weather descriptions. This will also likely be taken from the subset of visual sightings instead of from all reports. \n\n### Creating a Region Column\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Creating separate vectors for each region\nPacific <- c(\"California\", \"Oregon\", \"Washington\", \"Alaska\")\nMountain <- c(\"Nevada\", \"Arizona\", \"New Mexico\", \"Colorado\", \"Utah\", \"Idaho\", \"Montana\", \"Wyoming\")\nWest_North_Central <- c(\"Minnesota\", \"North Dakota\", \"South Dakota\", \"Iowa\", \"Nebraska\", \"Kansas\", \"Missouri\")\nWest_South_Central <- c(\"Texas\", \"Oklahoma\", \"Louisiana\", \"Arkansas\")\nEast_North_Central <- c(\"Ohio\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Michigan\", \"Illinois\", \"Indiana\")\nEast_South_Central <- c(\"Alabama\", \"Kentucky\", \"Tennessee\", \"Mississippi\")\nSouth_Atlantic <- c(\"Florida\", \"Georgia\", \"South Carolina\", \"North Carolina\", \"Virginia\", \"West Virginia\", \"Maryland\", \"Delaware\")\nMid_Atlantic <- c(\"Pennsylvania\", \"New York\", \"New Jersey\")\nNew_England <- c(\"Connecticut\", \"Rhode Island\", \"Massachusetts\", 'Vermont', \"New Hampshire\", \"Maine\")\n\n# Mutating new column using the vectors above\nbfro <- bfro %>%\n  mutate(\n    Region = case_when(state %in% Pacific ~ \"Pacific\",\n                       state %in% Mountain ~ \"Mountain\",\n                       state %in% West_North_Central ~ \"West North Central\",\n                       state %in% West_South_Central ~ \"West South Central\",\n                       state %in% East_North_Central ~ \"East North Central\",\n                       state %in% East_South_Central ~ \"East South Central\",\n                       state %in% South_Atlantic ~ \"South Atlantic\",\n                       state %in% Mid_Atlantic ~ \"Mid-Atlantic\",\n                       state %in% New_England ~ \"New England\")\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's do a quick sanity check on that new column: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Select the state and Region columns from the dataset and look at a sample with head()\nbfro %>% \n  select(state, Region) %>%\n  head(15)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"state\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Region\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Alabama\",\"2\":\"East South Central\"},{\"1\":\"Alaska\",\"2\":\"Pacific\"},{\"1\":\"Rhode Island\",\"2\":\"New England\"},{\"1\":\"Pennsylvania\",\"2\":\"Mid-Atlantic\"},{\"1\":\"Oregon\",\"2\":\"Pacific\"},{\"1\":\"Oklahoma\",\"2\":\"West South Central\"},{\"1\":\"Ohio\",\"2\":\"East North Central\"},{\"1\":\"New York\",\"2\":\"Mid-Atlantic\"},{\"1\":\"Nevada\",\"2\":\"Mountain\"},{\"1\":\"New Jersey\",\"2\":\"Mid-Atlantic\"},{\"1\":\"New Hampshire\",\"2\":\"New England\"},{\"1\":\"Nebraska\",\"2\":\"West North Central\"},{\"1\":\"North Dakota\",\"2\":\"West North Central\"},{\"1\":\"North Carolina\",\"2\":\"South Atlantic\"},{\"1\":\"Montana\",\"2\":\"Mountain\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOkay, good - this sample of the first 15 values of the state & Region columns indicate that the states have been categorized into their correct regions.\n",
