And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n  - abc_poll ⭐⭐\n  \nread the abc_poll_2021.csv\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- read.csv(\"_data/abc_poll_2021.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\nIn this data, I want to look at the relationship between education and political party affiliation. Therefore, I table to show the value of my idea. In this table, the rows show 4 different education and the rows show 5 types of political here.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(df$ppeducat,df$QPID)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                            \n                             A Democrat A Republican An Independent Skipped\n  Bachelors degree or higher         72           55             73       0\n  High school                        37           41             43       1\n  Less than high school              12           10              4       1\n  Some college                       55           46             48       1\n                            \n                             Something else\n  Bachelors degree or higher              7\n  High school                            11\n  Less than high school                   2\n  Some college                            8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWell, I don't want to show some of political party affiliation with A or A[n] so I used the \"str_remove\" to remove the words.\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf1 <- df %>%\n  mutate(partyid = str_remove(QPID, \"A[n]* \"),\n         partyid = na_if(partyid, \"Skipped\")) %>%\n  select(-QPID)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\nIn the Visualization, I used the bar chat to show the Education with 5 different political. Therefore, it is easy for us to understand those.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npartyvseducation<-table(df1$partyid,abc_poll_new$ppeducat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in table(df1$partyid, abc_poll_new$ppeducat): 找不到物件 'abc_poll_new'\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmyFrame <- as.data.frame(table(partyvseducation))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in table(partyvseducation): 找不到物件 'partyvseducation'\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nparty_graphic<-ggplot(abc_poll_new, aes(abc_poll_new$ppeducat, ..count..)) + \n  geom_bar(aes(fill = abc_poll_new$partyid), position = \"dodge\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(abc_poll_new, aes(abc_poll_new$ppeducat, ..count..)): 找不到物件 'abc_poll_new'\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  print(party_graphic + labs(fill = \"Political\", x = \"Education\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in print(party_graphic + labs(fill = \"Political\", x = \"Education\")): 找不到物件 'party_graphic'\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
